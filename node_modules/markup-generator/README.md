##  markup-generator module

`yarn add markup-generator`

It's just an HTML file generator

Main reason - we want to generate an HTML email newsletter automatically, so generator must have methods that can help you to save a file.


Submodule for https://github.com/atherdon/markdown-to-email


```
import { writeHTML, generateTemplateName } from 'markup-generator'

const content = '<html></html>'; // long html template stored in this variable
const fileName = generateTemplateName('prefix-for-your-generated-file');

writeHTML(fileName, content);
```


### TODO
- [ ] move tests here

- [ ] Creating a browser bundle that depends on "path". You might need to include https://github.com/snowpackjs/rollup-plugin-polyfill-node
https://github.com/atherdon/markdown-regex/blob/main/rollup.config.js#L2
https://github.com/atherdon/markdown-regex/blob/main/rollup.config.js#L115
