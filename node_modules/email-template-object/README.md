# template-object

`yarn add email-template-object`


We need to have

- A tree like structure for rendering components in "recursive" way

- An ability to add checks with returning errors.

- An ability to have isError variable that will help us to understand if everything is ok or not.

- be able to return data.

- merge it with test cases that we had before.

- think how to handle subcomponents better.

- have a template object that we can use as source too

```
import displayFactoryTwo from './factoryTwo';

// const settings = {
//     component: "",
    
//     params: {},
    
// }

// const EmptyTemplateFactory = new displayFactoryTwo();

// export default EmptyTemplateFactory.create(settings);

```
